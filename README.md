# Alfred-Discord-Bot

Having finally convinced the crew to switch to Discord, Allie complained it didn't have Gifs. This project is a bot, originally intended to just link in the Gifs. Now I'm just messing around, having fun adding additional features.

## Prerequisites
    * Node.js
    * A Discord bot application
    * A Giphy API key
    
## Installing
    * Have Node.js installed https://nodejs.org/en/, I used v12.19.0
    * Run install.cmd
    * Make a Discord bot https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
    * Set the environment variable DISCORD_KEY to your bot's key
    * Make a Giphy developer account and app https://developers.giphy.com/
    * Set the environment variable GIPHY_KEY to your giphy key

## Deployment
    * Add the discord bot you made to a server by going to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=8 but replacing CLIENTID with your app's client id.
    * Run bot.js on a server somewhere
